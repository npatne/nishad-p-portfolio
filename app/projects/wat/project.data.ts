    content: "**Making Complex Analytics Actually Usable**\n\nThe Learning Engineering Institute (LEI) had built the Writing Analytics Tool (WAT), an open-source platform that uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze student writing for teachers and researchers.\n\n **The problem?** _The initial MVP, built by developers, had a clunky interface, confusing user flows, and feedback that was impossible to understand._\n\nThis created real barriers. Teachers couldn't tap into WAT's powerful analytics, and students couldn't make sense of their writing performance data.\n#### I needed to:\n- **Modernize the platform** - Turn the existing MVP into something intuitive and scalable\n\n- **Make feedback useful** - Design interfaces that turned complex NLP data into actionable insights\n\n- **Support different user needs** - Work for students seeking revision help, teachers facilitating practice.\n\n- **Address adoption concerns** - Ensure teachers would actually use it despite worries about increased workload and confusing analytics",

Teachers needed quick overviews and actionable insights.\n\n**Solution Evolution:**\n- Initial designs used progress bar style interpretation of metric outcome (in % value).\n- Post-focus group, I moved to a 2-column layout (collapsible essay view + tabs for rubric/analytics)\n- I introduced spider charts for holistic metric snapshots and line graphs for progress tracking\n\n**Key Innovation:** I replaced simple spectrum scores with a Likert-scale based interpretation. Teachers could indicate a desired leaning for each metric during assignment setup. Students then saw their score relative to this target, making feedback constructive rather than judgmental.\n\n**Impact:** This transformed feedback from potentially confusing data points into guided, non-judgmental insights, significantly improving perceived usability and value for both teachers and students. This design was approved and moved into production.",
