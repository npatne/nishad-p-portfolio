    content: "The iSTART Early initiative needed to transform a legacy concept into a modern, engaging learning platform for 3rd-5th graders. I faced a complex, three-front challenge:\n\n**A Foundational Void:** The platform completely lacked a teacher-facing interface. Educators had no tools to manage classes, assign work, or monitor student progress, making the system unusable in real classroom settings.\n\n**A Fragmented Student Experience:** An existing student portal served as a gamified hub, but it was built without clear direction. It had major UI/UX inconsistencies, poor navigation, and a disjointed connection to the core learning activities.\n\n**Isolated Learning Content:** The actual learning modules—games, lessons, and quizzes—were functionally and visually disconnected from the main platform, creating a jarring user experience that hurt engagement and learning.",

    content: "**Process: Building, Enhancing, and Systematizing**\n\nMy approach was to build the missing foundation, enhance the existing student experience, and wrap it all in a scalable system for long-term quality and velocity.\n\n#### 1. Discovery & Foundational Build\n\nMy first priority was creating the non-existent Teacher Portal. I conducted competitive analysis of established Learning Management Systems, interviewed stakeholders, and defined core teacher user stories. This research informed the creation of a complete, intuitive system for class management, assignment creation, and progress tracking, which I designed from wireframes to high-fidelity prototypes.\n\n#### 2. Enhancement & Deep Integration\n\nSimultaneously, I focused on the student experience through two major workstreams:\n\n**Enhancing the Hub:** I redesigned the main Student Portal to improve navigation, create visual consistency, and better integrate gamification elements like \"iBucks\" rewards and student avatar.\n\n**Developing the Modules:** I designed and developed over 10 interactive Storyline modules. This was a significant technical and design lift, requiring me to write custom JavaScript to pass data (like content, scores and completion status) back to the main platform, ensuring seamless flow between the hub and learning content.\n\n#### 3. Systematization & Scaling\n\nTo manage the platform's complexity, I established formal UX infrastructure. I built a comprehensive design system in Figma, created a centralized UX Copy Style Guide **(integrated pipeline figma variables to  CSS variables)** for consistent language, and implemented a formal usability testing protocol to embed user feedback directly into our development sprints in Asana.",

A colleague's initial proposal was based on static PNGs, which I initially approved. However, recognizing the technical limitations, it was not pragmatic to continue and I knew we had to **pivot**.\n\nI researched programmatic alternatives and led creation of a proof-of-concept using the _'Avataaars'_ SVG library.\n\nWe presented this more scalable and efficient solution to the leadership, and we collectively decided to implement this in production.\n\nThis initiative not only resulted in a better feature but also elevated our team's approach to technical design challenges and important pivot experience for junior designers in the team.",

This was a deep exploration of design craftsmanship and forward-thinking technology.\n\n**The Vision:** The concept reimagines iSTART as an AI-powered learning companion. The _pedagogical_ AI agent, Matty, becomes the central conversational interface, transforming the experience from a passive tool into an active, supportive partner for the student.\n\n**Design Craftsmanship:** I used AI tools like DALL-E to rapidly generate unique, space-themed graphic assets and character concepts for Matty and integrate existing iStart Early design theme to extend this mobile app.\n\nThe final deliverable was a polished, fully-prototyped mobile experience that showcases a vision for more accessible, personal, and engaging educational technology.\n\n**Checkout the design documents here:**\n\n- [Design File](https://www.google.com)\n- [Live Prototype](https://www.google.com)\n- [Flowchart Diagram](https://www.google.com)",
